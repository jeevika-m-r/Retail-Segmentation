**Retail Customer Segmentation Using Python & Machine Learning**

**Project Overview :**

This project involves building a customer segmentation model using transactional data from a UK-based online retailer. The primary objective is to improve marketing strategies and sales by segmenting customers into distinct groups using the K-means clustering algorithm. The segmentation provides insights into customer profiles and preferences, which can be leveraged to create targeted marketing campaigns and personalized recommendations.

This project was undertaken during my internship with the Edunet Foundation, in collaboration with EY and AICTE, where I gained practical experience in data analysis and machine learning.

**Project Structure :**
- **Data Cleaning & Transformation:** Handling missing values, duplicates, outliers, and transforming raw data into a customer-centric dataset.
- **Feature Engineering:** Creating new features such as Recency, Frequency, Monetary (RFM), and other behavioural and geographic features to enhance the data for clustering.
- **Data Pre-processing:** Scaling features and reducing dimensionality to improve the efficiency and accuracy of the clustering process.
- **K-Means Clustering:** Segmenting customers into groups using the K-means algorithm and evaluating the quality of the clusters.
- **Cluster Analysis & Profiling:** Analysing and profiling each customer segment to understand distinct characteristics and preferences.
- **Recommendation System:** Developing a recommendation system to suggest top-selling products to customers within each segment who haven't purchased those items yet.

**Results :**

- *Customer Segments:* The model successfully segmented customers into distinct groups, each with unique purchasing behaviours and preferences.
- *Recommendation System:* The developed system can suggest top-selling products to customers who haven't purchased them yet, aiming to increase sales and improve customer satisfaction.
